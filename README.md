ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ricardo, front end developer from Brazil.

I've been working with web development for 7 years, I started my career as a back-end developer and gradually moved to the front-end, I also have some experience with android native app development.

I want to be a React rock star developer so I'm always learning something new, here in my GitHub is where you can find my experiments :neckbeard:!

:point_right: One last thing to know about me (especially if you are a recruiter or someone interesting in hire me :wink:).
I studied english in Ireland for 3 years and curretly I'm living in Brazil, but I'm looking for a opportunity to live abroad, so I can give my wife and baby girl a better life!
