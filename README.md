ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ricardo, front end developer from Brazil.

I've been working with web development for 6 years, I started my career as a back-end developer and gradually moved to the front-end, I also have some experience with android native app development.

I want to be a front-end rock star developer so I'm always learning something new, here in my GitHub is where you can find my experiments :neckbeard:
