ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ricardo, a front end developer from Brazil.

I've been working with web development for over 6 years, I started my career as a back-end developer with .Net/C# and gradually moved to the front-end, I also have some experience with android native app development.

Nowadays I'm focused on front end development with React and my goal as a developer is to become a full stack developer with Node JS. Here in my GitHub is where you can find my experiments. :neckbeard:
